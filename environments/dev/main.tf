  region = "us-east-1" /*
  Region: us-east-1 (can be changed as needed).
  Make sure all resources are deployed in the same region to avoid cross-region issues.

  Objective:
  We are creating three resources — EC2, VPC, and S3 — each defined as a separate Terraform resource.

  Module Structure:
  - Each resource is placed in its own module: `ec2`, `vpc`, and `s3`.
  - Using modules allows us to reuse code efficiently across multiple environments (dev, test, prod).
  - This modular approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces duplication.
